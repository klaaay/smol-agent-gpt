The shared dependencies between the files we are generating are:

1. **Next.js**: This is the main framework used for building the application. It is used in all the files for server-side rendering and routing.

2. **React**: Next.js is built on top of React, so React components and hooks are used throughout the application.

3. **TypeScript**: TypeScript is used in all the .tsx files for type checking and improved developer experience.

4. **React-DOM**: This is used in _document.tsx for rendering the application on the server side.

5. **Package.json dependencies**: All the dependencies required for the application are listed in the package.json file. These dependencies are shared across all the files in the application.

6. **CSS Modules**: The global CSS styles are defined in globals.css and are used across all the pages of the application.

7. **Public assets**: The public assets like favicon.ico and vercel.svg are used in _document.tsx for setting up the HTML template of the application.

8. **Custom App Component**: The custom App component (_app.tsx) is used to initialize pages. It can be used to keep state between pages.

9. **Custom Document**: The custom Document (_document.tsx) is used to augment the application's html and body tags.

10. **Index Page**: The index page (index.tsx) is the main entry point of the application.

Please note that specific exported variables, data schemas, id names of DOM elements, message names, and function names would depend on the specific implementation of the application and are not known at this stage.
